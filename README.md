<h1>Pokémon Card List App</h1>

This is a simple React Native app that displays a collection of Pokémon cards, grouped by their element type. Each section (Electric, Water, Fire) has its own color theme and icon, so you can quickly see which Pokémon belong to which element.

At the top of the screen, there’s an “ADD POKEMON” button that will be used in a future lesson to insert new cards into the list. For now, the main focus is on the list itself: each row shows the Pokémon’s name on the left and the actual card image on the right, loaded from an online URL. Tapping on a Pokémon triggers a fun toast message saying that a Pokémon has appeared nearby.

The app uses:

- SectionList to group Pokémon by element

- Online images from the official Pokémon TCG gallery

- Expo vector icons (FontAwesome5) for element icons (bolt, water, fire)

- Simple styling to keep the layout clean and readable on mobile
